# bootcamp-webgame-project
For this project, I made a Music Trivia game. In this game, the user can choose between the following 3 categories: 70's, 80's, and 90's. These categories represent a decade of music. When the user chooses a decade, they are taken into a 10 question quiz that corresponds to the selected decade. If a correct answer is given, the user is notified that the answer is correct with a pop up alert, and the next question is displayed. If an incorrect answer is given, a pop up alert says "Incorrect, Try again" and the user is taken back to the main menu. If a user makes it through the entire quiz, they are also taken back to the main menu after getting a pop up alert.
